# Docker Base Images

[![Docker](https://github.com/viral32111/docker-base-images/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/viral32111/docker-base-images/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

This repository builds & publishes my base Docker images that I use across all my other projects.

I do **not** recommend that you use these images as base images in your own projects as they are tailored towards my needs!
